Part 1 - Initial Configuration
##############################

Get the latest version of Raspbian Wheezy:
http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/

Image your SD card:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/

On boot up be sure to:
1. Expand the file system to use all available space on your SD card.
2. Under the advanced options, Enable SSH access
3. Under Internationalization options, go to the keyboard layout, select other, then English (US)
4. OPTIONAL: set the hostname
5. reboot


if your Rpi doesn't boot to the raspi-config menu you can launch it with:
sudo raspi-config

if you need to manually reboot:
sudo reboot

if you need to manually poweroff:
sudo poweroff

go ahead and install vim so that you have a text editor
sudo apt-get install vim


Part 2 - Enabling Wifi
######################
You can find instructions for this several places on the internet.  Lets use this one: http://www.frodebang.com/p/1

All you have to do is plug in your WiFi adapter and make some changes to /etc/network/interfaces
sudo vi /etc/network/interfaces
My interfaces file looks like this. I commented out three lines and added the third lines at the bottom.
auto lo

iface lo inet loopback
iface eth0 inet dhcp

allow-hotplug wlan0
#iface wlan0 inet manual
#wpa-roam /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
#iface default inet dhcp

iface wlan0 inet dhcp
wpa-ssid <YOUR SSID>
wpa-psk <YOUR PASSPHRASE/KEY>

Save the file and reboot.
sudo shutdown -r now

Hopefully you now have a working wireless connection.
